                <h1>About the 340B Optimizer</h1>
                <p>How does the 340B Optimizer help?</p>

<p>The 340B Optimizer is designed to streamline the 340B Drug Pricing Program process. We designed the software for pharmaceutical distributors and manufacturers with the understanding that compliance and client relationships are paramount.
</p>
<strong>Contract Pharmacy
</strong>
<p>Our Contract Pharmacy Module is built for compliance and virility. We give Covered Entities endless tools to audit compliance and determine savings captured in order to evaluate pharmacies in the contract pharmacy network.
</p>
<strong>Pharmacy Tools
</strong>
<p>Tools to keep your pharmacy informed. Advanced notification of shipments will help your contract pharmacy manage inventory and prevent returns. Clear statements of what claims are due and associated with the 340B replenished product will assist in collecting payment for your covered entity and increase confidence at the contract pharmacy level.
</p>
<strong>Evaluation Tools
</strong>
<p>Clear visibility into savings generated at multiple levels. Clear visual into savings generated by each contract pharmacy with dispensing fees and admin fees factored in. Brand vs Generic capture rates as well savings reported per script, per NPI, per NDC, and per BIN (insurnance plan). All of these tools assist covered entities in determining the successful launch of new contract pharmacies as well as evaluate existing contract pharmacies.
</p>
<strong>High Touch Client Relationships
</strong>
<p>You will not be another ticket number with the 340B Optimizer. We have dedicated support sta that you can ask for by name. Your sales rep will stay with you throughout the entire partnership and consult whenever you need. We need you to be successful in order for us to be successful.
</p>
<strong>Audit Ready
</strong>
<p>Complete audit trail accountability is offered through extensive tracking and reporting features that record all transactions. Reports can be generated by patient ID (audits are patient driven) making it easy to run reports by patient ID number. Convenient and efficient ability to download transaction and eligibility data for any type of audit.
</p>
<strong>No True-Up Model
</strong>
<p>Our model does not ask for revenue from pharmacies until a full orderable package has been dispensed. is means we accumulate claims until the claims total a full package. Once this happens, a bottle is shipped to the pharmacy and the claims are captured and billed to the pharmacy. is prevents the need of true-ups.
